Loco

Girl a cada mañana
Te deseo tanto
Cómo sueño en madrugada
Son las doce y pico
En la radio tu song favorito
Tú mi gyal
Tú mi like
Yo te sigo
El punch line
Lo gritamos bonito
Cuando suena nuestra canción
Yo te digo
Que me gustas
Mucho con bastante
Cómo mango y limón saborearte
Solo a ti yo quiero acostumbrarme
Pa' toda la vida
Tenerte y amarte
Waiyo!
Tú me traes loco
Shalalala la
Loco, loco de remate
Waiyo!
Tú me traes loco
Lo lo lo loco
Loco de remate
Oh yeh
Soy quien mira tus fotos
Cuando no hay nadie
Soy quien te piensa siempre
Baby a cada instante
Tú eres la dulce fruta
Que mi paladar
Añora, y siempre te quiere probar

Do I Wanna Know?

Have you got color in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee
If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
